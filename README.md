An exercise in CI/CD

This repo exemplifies several possible workflows, starting from the naive to the optimal.


1. naive push - on every push to github, the image is built and pushed to DockerHub

2. naive push + cache

3. wip: only versions are pushed to Docker Hub. the rest are pushed to Github Registry
